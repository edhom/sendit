# sendit

SendIT is a mobile application which acts as an IoT gateway for sensors on a mountainbike. A user can connect to different sensors and select which data should get monitored. Any BLE sensor is compatible and the applicationâ€™s architecture is designed for great extensibility. SendIT allows to manage recordings and to explore mountain bike trails on a map. The application is available for iOS and Android and partially also on web, due to the cross-platform capabilities of the Flutter framework. SendIT uses a client-server architecture. The server part is realized via Firebase.
